# K&K Cabinets & Countertops Company Website

This is the K&K Cabinets & Countertops company's website.

## Description

- K&K Cabinets & Countertops is a company that is based in Kitchener, ON, which provides design & installation solutions for top quality cabinets & countertops. The company has been serving local clients for more than 20 years and is currently led by head designer Zenia Horton.
- The company needed a remake of their official website back in 2020 and was collecting ideas from many web developers by hosting a web design contest.
- As a participating student who was learning web development at the time, this web design ended up taking 2nd place in the contest.
- This is actually an improved version of my original design, as I have become a better web developer over the years and I thought I would be able to recreate this web design with better & more efficient code.
